# Anime Data Analyses and Anime Recommendation Website.

(This website is built as a part of the course CSS431: Big Data Project.)

On the home page, on the menu bar at the top, the user can see the processed data that had been visualized for the years 2018 and 2023 based on different subjects.

For the recommendation function, the user can enter their favorite anime name to get a recommendation based on the given anime.

Note:
The recommendation API needs to be enabled by the team member, or else the function will cause an Internal Server error.
